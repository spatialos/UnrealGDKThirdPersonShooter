Note that this project and the contents of this repository are in a **pre-alpha stage**, meaning that they are meant for evaluation only.

## Introduction

This project is a sample third-person shooter deathmatch game implemented on top of the SpatialOS Unreal GDK. It is meant to be a reference project and/or a starting point for those building games on SpatialOS and Unreal Engine 4. In the game, you can join a team, run around, shoot characters on other teams, and spawn "test cubes" (cubes you can shoot around).

For setup instructions, follow [the guide in the SpatialOS Unreal GDK repository](https://github.com/improbable/UnrealGDK/blob/master/docs/setup-and-installing.md), replacing the "Starter Project" repository with this one.

For more information, see the [SpatialOS Unreal GDK repository](https://github.com/improbable/UnrealGDK) and its [documentation](https://github.com/improbable/UnrealGDK/blob/master/docs/readme.md).
