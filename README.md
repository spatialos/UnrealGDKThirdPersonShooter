This project is a sample third-person shooter deathmatch game which uses the [SpatialOS GDK for Unreal](https://github.com/spatialos/unrealGDK). 

It is both a reference project and a starting point for those building games on SpatialOS and Unreal Engine 4. In the game, you can join a team, run around, shoot characters on other teams, and spawn "test cubes" (which are cubes you can shoot around).


For setup instructions, follow the [Get started](https://docs.improbable.io/unreal/latest/get-started/introduction) guide in the GDK for Unreal documentation. This guide uses the [GDK for Unreal Starter Project](https://github.com/spatialos/UnrealGDKStarterProject) as an example. When you follow the installation instructions, you need to replace the "Starter Project" repository with the Third-Person Shooter one.

For more information, see the [SpatialOS GDK for Unreal documentation](https://docs.improbable.io/unreal/latest/).
